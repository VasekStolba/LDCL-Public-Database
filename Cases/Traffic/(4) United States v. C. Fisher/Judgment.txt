United States v. C. Fisher

===

Officer's Testimony (Philip Henry, LCSO)

"I was driving in the highway 55 and I saw this car blue truck in 5+ over. So i pull over him. When I pull over him i said for speeding 5+ over. And when I check this plate on my system. I never find a driver license. So, i told him why he don't have license? I said you can go with a fine of $800 in the penal code."

Defendant's Testimony

"I am not fighting my speed, as I agree I went over the limit. However, I believe the charge was incorrect. At the time, I had a driver's license, however it was still pending DMV review. Even thought it might not have been fully valid, the act does not fit the "Driving On A Suspended/Revoked License" charge criteria."

In response to the defendant's testimony, the officer stated that;

"Okay i think i put the incorrect charge"
