In order to file out a form, download the file and open it in your local PDF editor (can be some simple Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome version). Once done, upload the filled PDF to Google Drive (in the PDF format) and make a share link (with the perms *Viewers and commenters can see the option to download, print, and copy* and *Anyone on the internet with the link can view*). Then, send that link to the court (for complaints, through a google form, for active cases, through DMs or some other designated ways).
